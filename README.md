# Data Mmining 2015
My project for Data Mining course at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, Master degree in Computer Science.

This project consist in an analysis of data relative to a bike sharing service. The goal is to apply and compare different data mining techniques to predict number of rent bikes with reference to several variables, such as weather conditions or day of the week.

Analysis is performed in R.
